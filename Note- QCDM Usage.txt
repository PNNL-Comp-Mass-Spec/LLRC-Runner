QCDM was originally compiled with R 2.x; the following files are for use with R 2.x:
  Lib\QCDM_2013.07.26.zip
  Lib\QCDM_2013.09.27.zip

In March 2020 it was updated to work with R 3.x (and also R 4.x)
  Lib\QCDM contains the R Studio project
  Lib\QCDM_2020.05.04.tar.gz

Prior to November 2015 the Analysis Manager ran QCDM as part of the SMAQC step tool.
* After installing R 3.x that processing no longer worked and QCDM is thus skipped

QCDM is, however, run every 4 hours on Gigasax, started via the DMS Program Runner

(prior to 2023 it was started using SQL Server Agent job "Compute LLRC")

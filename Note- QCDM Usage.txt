QCDM was originally compiled with R 2.x; the following files are for use with R 2.x:
  Lib\QCDM_2013.07.26.zip
  Lib\QCDM_2013.09.27.zip

It was updated (minimally) to work with R 3.x in March 2020:
  Lib\QCDM contains the R Studio project
  Lib\QCDM_2020.05.04.tar.gz

Prior to November 2015 the Analysis Manager ran QCDM as part of the SMAQC step tool.
After installing R 3.x that processing no longer worked and QCDM is thus skipped.

QCDM is, however, run by Gigasax, starting it using Sql Server Agent job "Compute LLRC"
